The goal of this assignment was to create a console level employee management system using Mysql and Node.js

TO accomplish this goal a schema was created with the requirements set forth in the assignment readme, and seeded with entries using seeds.sql. Index.js was created to handle all of the methods for adding, removing, and altering employee entries.

A walkthrough of the functionality of the application can be viewed at:
